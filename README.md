Construction Grade Linux

## 🚧 Under Construction 🚧

This tool does not yet build a working desktop image and is not appropriate for production at this time.

## 🏝️ About 🏝️

This project seeks to produce an opinionated Linux desktop with the following components/features:

* Bootc - OS images are distributed as OCI container images, bundled with a kernel and the necessary tools to execute the container on bare metal or a VM. This provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks.
* Debian - The base operating system which provides an extremely stable platform and familiar tools for developers.
* SwayWM - A minimal but highly functional window manager, bundled with complementary utilities.

This project primarily exists as a testing ground for new operating system and build toolchainfeatures related to the [SpamTagger](/SpamTagger/SpamTagger-Bootc) spam filtering appliance. I intend to use this OS as my daily driver as soon as it is stable so that I can remain on top of any changes which might also impact that product.

The project name and logo are inspired by a combination of the SwayWM spin of Fedora which used to be called "Sericea" (the Latin name for the Dogwood tree), and the Debian swirl which vaguely resembles a knot pattern. Pine is a sturdy, reliable wood which is also a commodity which can be easily and cheaply chopped down and replaced with newer revisions.
